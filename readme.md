# Unix Kernel Exploits

A repository for kernel exploits consisting mostly of privilege escalation attacks against core components of UNIX distribtions.

## Guidelines

1. The exploit cannot contain pre-compiled code.
2. Each of the compilation and running steps must be documented.
3. The exploited applications must be part of a default distribution installation.
4. Each exploit must have a proof attached in the form of an auto hacked dockerfile.
5. All exploits must have an assigned issue, which will not be closed. (for discussion)
